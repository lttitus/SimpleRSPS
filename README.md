A clean and simple RSPS base for the 508 release, rewritten from the ground up.

Requires you to set up a database on your local machine on port 3306.
This database will need to be named "simplersps", with a username of "rsps" and a password of "simplersps"; These options can be changed within the Engine.java file.
Additionally, for a quick setup, you may import the following [JSON](data/db_import.json) file to create the basics.
